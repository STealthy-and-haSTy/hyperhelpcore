*|Style Conventions|*
=================

In order to remain as consistent as possible for all users of help,  HyperHelp
imposes some limitations on the layout of help in the |help view| in the form
of custom settings applied that override user settings.

    * `word_wrap` is disabled, so all help should optimally be presentable in
      no more than 80 characters of text. This matches the width of the
      generated |file header| in the displayed help.

    * `tab_size` is set to `1`. This is to ensure that help does not display
      indent widths that are not what the author intended.

    * `convert_tabs_to_spaces` is disabled so that raw tab characters can be
      inserted into the buffer. These are used to provide white space inside
      of |anchors| and |links|, as well as to define |separators|.
