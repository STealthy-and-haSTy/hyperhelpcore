%hyperhelp title="HyperHelp ChangeLog" date="2019-10-31"


## latest_update:Version 0.0.7 (2019-10-31)
-------------------------------

  * On install or upgrade, the HyperHelp system package will now display
    either the `changelog.txt` file or the `help_on_help.txt` file, so
    that you either learn how to use the help system or see what is new.

    The new setting `show_changelog` controls whether this is active or
    not; it defaults to `True`.


## _none:Version 0.0.6 (2019-10-31)
-------------------------------

  * This changelog file now exists to indicate the version history of the
    package over time. The help index, command palette and the main menu can
    all be used to navigate to the file.

  * The |dependency settings| have been changed to use a prefix of `hyperhelp.`
    instead of `hyperhelp_`, as |PackageDev| syntax highlights that format
    directly. In addition, a hint file was added so that PackageDev can show
    you default values and auto-complete the settings directly.

  * The commands that create and navigate to bookmarks from the command palette
    have been modified to use the `show_overlay` command rather than invoking
    the command directly.


## _none:Version 0.0.5 (2019-03-31)
-------------------------------

  * Include a command to display the package version of the bootstrapped
    package and of the dependency in preparation for the initial public
    announcement on April 1.


## _none:Version 0.0.4 (2019-03-27)
-----------------------------

  * Bump the internal version number which was accidentally skipped from the
    0.0.3 release, stopping existing installs from seeing the changes.


## _none:Version 0.0.3 (2019-03-25)
-----------------------------

  * Enhance key contexts used in key bindings

  * Ensure that when the history index panel is opened, the current help item
    is initially selected.

  * While post processing, removal of comments would also remove comments from
    in-line code blocks; this has been fixed.

  * Rewrite the internal help to be more up to date with how the package has
    been rewritten in the last year.


## _none:Version 0.0.2 (2019-03-07)
-----------------------------

  * Watch `ignored_packages` to determine when packages are being ignored or
    unignored and load or drop their indexes as needed to keep help in sync
    with packages.

  * Fix a bug in bootstrapping that would block it from happening if the
    package was unpacked.


## _none:Version 0.0.1 (2019-02-17)
-----------------------------

  * Initial release
