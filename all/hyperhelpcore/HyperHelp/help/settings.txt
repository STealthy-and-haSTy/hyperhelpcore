# _none:Settings Overview
===================

Like most packages, HyperHelp allows you to customize its behaviour by
providing various settings for you to configure as you see fit. However, unlike
most packages, HyperHelp consists of both a dependency that powers the help
system and a regular package that allows you to interact with it.

For this reason, some settings are specific to the HyperHelp package and work
like normal package settings, while others are specific to the dependency and
go in the global |Preferences.sublime-settings| preferences file instead.


## Package Settings
-------------------

The settings here go in the HyperHelp specific settings file, which you can get
to by selecting `Preferences > Package Settings > HyperHelp > Settings` from
the main menu.

    *hyperhelp_date_format*

        This setting controls the format of the last modification date that
        appears in the |header| line of all help files. Changes to this setting
        will be applied when the next help file is loaded.

        The default value for this is setting is `%x`, which sets a date format
        that's appropriate for the area of the world in which you live.

        You can use any of the format specifiers given in the |Python 3.3 docs|
        on the |strftime() and strptime() behavior| page.

        Note however that no time stamps are stored for file times, only dates.
        As such you should avoid any fields that tell you the time of the day.

    *show_changelog*

        When this setting is enabled (which is the default), when HyperHelp is
        first installed it will display the |help_on_help.txt| file to help you
        learn how to use it.

        Similarly, whenever the package is upgraded the |:latest_update:latest entry| in the
        |changelog.txt| file will be displayed to keep you informed on the most
        recent changes and bug fixes.


## Dependency Settings
----------------------

The settings here are referenced by the dependency portion of HyperHelp and go
in the |Preferences.sublime-settings| file because they need to be available
even if the HyperHelp package is ignored or unavailable.

If you use the |PackageDev| package, it will syntax highlight these settings
differently, and will also provide auto-complete and hover popups for them as
well.

    *hyperhelp.ignore_disabled*

        Normally, the hyperhelp core dependency performs a check at startup to
        ensure that the HyperHelp package itself is not in the list of ignored
        packages.

        This is to ensure that problems caused by partial |:bootstrapping:bootstraps| don't go
        unnoticed, which can cause confusing issues.

        Should you actually want to have HyperHelp in the list of ignored
        packages, this setting should be added to your user preferences to tell
        the core that you intentionally ignored HyperHelp.
