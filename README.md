HyperHelp and hyperhelpcore
============================

hyperhelpcore is a dependency package for Sublime Text 3 that allows package
authors to provide context sensitive, hyperlinked help for their packages that
is displayable directly from within Sublime Text itself.

At first startup, hyperhelpcore will generate a HyperHelp package in the
InstalledPackages folder to expose the help functionality, and ensure that it
is always up to date.

Some packages using hyperhelpcore:

  * [SnAPI](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/SnAPI) - View the
    documentation for Sublime Text directly within Sublime
  * [HyperHelpAuthor](https://github.com/STealthy-and-haSTy/HyperHelpAuthor) -
    Simple authoring tools for hyperhelpcore

**NOTE:** This is very much still a work in progress and still being actively
developed and tweaked. At this point anything and everything is subject to
change without notice.
